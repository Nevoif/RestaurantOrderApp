Restaurant Order Management System

A Windows-based Restaurant Order Management System built with .NET 8, developed for real-world use in a small restaurant environment.

The application handles order tracking and payment records, including:

payment method

payment amount

payment timestamp

Application settings and persistent data are stored in JSON files, keeping the system lightweight and easy to modify or extend.

Some releases require .NET 8 to be installed, while the latest versions are packaged to work out of the box.

⚠️ This project is experimental and was built for personal use for a relative’s restaurant.
The UI was partially generated with AI assistance, while the application logic and system behavior were implemented by me.

The codebase may look rough in places, but it is functional and actively used.
Feel free to copy, modify, or adapt it to your own needs.
